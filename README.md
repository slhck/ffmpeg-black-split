# ffmpeg Black Split

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ffmpeg-black-split.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg-black-split)

[![Python package](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-black-split/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-black-split/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

Split a video based on black frames.

This tool uses the [`blackdetect` filter](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#blackdetect) from ffmpeg to determine the periods of black content.

It can cut the video into segments based on these periods, and also output the detected black and content periods as JSON.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- FFmpeg:
  - download a static build from [their website](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html))
  - put the `ffmpeg` executable in your `$PATH`

## Installation

Simply run it via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```bash
uvx ffmpeg-black-split
```

Or install via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/).
Or with pip:

```bash
pip3 install --user ffmpeg_black_split
```

## Usage

Run:

```bash
ffmpeg-black-split <input-file>
```

This might take a while depending on the length of your input file. It'll then split the video into parts, prefixed by the original filename. The audio and video streams will be copied as-is.

The output will be placed in the current directory, with each file being named `<input>_<start>-<end>.mkv`.

Note that by default, cutting is not that accurate, as stream-copying is used. If you want to re-encode using x264, you can use the `--no-copy` flag. (Future versions may have better options for encoding.)

Choose a different output extension by specifying the `--output-extension` option. The default is `mkv`.

Pass the `--no-split` option to disable the actual splitting.

### JSON Output

Example to get just the JSON output:

```bash
ffmpeg-black-split input.mkv -p -v --no-split 2>/dev/null
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "black_periods": [
    {
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 5.0,
      "duration": 5.0
    },
    {
      "start": 10.0,
      "end": 15.0,
      "duration": 5.0
    },
    {
      "start": 20.0,
      "end": 25.0,
      "duration": 5.0
    }
  ],
  "content_periods": [
    {
      "start": 5.0,
      "end": 10.0
    },
    {
      "start": 10.0,
      "end": 20.0
    },
    {
      "start": 20.0,
      "end": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extended Usage

See `ffmpeg-black-split -h` for more:

```
usage: ffmpeg-black-split [-h] [-d BLACK_MIN_DURATION] [-r PICTURE_BLACK_RATIO_TH] [-t PIXEL_BLACK_TH]
                   [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [-e OUTPUT_EXTENSION] [--no-split] [--no-copy] [-p] [-v]
                   input

ffmpeg-black-split v0.4.0

positional arguments:
  input                 input file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d BLACK_MIN_DURATION, --black-min-duration BLACK_MIN_DURATION
                        Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must be
                        a non-negative floating point number. (default: 2.0)
  -r PICTURE_BLACK_RATIO_TH, --picture-black-ratio-th PICTURE_BLACK_RATIO_TH
                        Set the threshold for considering a picture 'black' (default: 0.98)
  -t PIXEL_BLACK_TH, --pixel-black-th PIXEL_BLACK_TH
                        Set the threshold for considering a pixel 'black' (default: 0.1)
  -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        Set the output directory. Default is the current working directory.
                        (default: None)
  -e OUTPUT_EXTENSION, --output-extension OUTPUT_EXTENSION
                        Set the ffmpeg output extension. Default is 'mkv'. Choose 'mov' for
                        QuickTime-compatible files. (default: mkv)
  --no-split            Don't split the video into segments. (default: False)
  --no-copy             Don't stream-copy, but re-encode the video. This is useful in case of
                        conversion errors when using different output formats. (default: False)
  -p, --progress        Show a progress bar on stderr (default: False)
  -v, --verbose         Print verbose info to stderr, and JSON of black and content periods to
                        stdout (default: False)
```

## API

The program exposes an API that you can use yourself:

```python
from ffmpeg_black_split import FfmpegBlackSplit

ffbs = FfmpegBlackSplit("input.mkv")
ffbs.detect_black_periods()
ffbs.cut_all_periods("/path/to/output/folder")
```

For more usage please read [the docs](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-black-split/blob/master/docs/ffmpeg_black_split.html).
